# simple-chess-bot

## About
This is a rather simple chess bot. I do not know its exact playing strength but it quite easily beats players rated around 850 Elo
on chess.com.

## Why another chess bot?
The goal of this bot was not to be a [Stockfish](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish) contender but just for me to have some fun writing it and for me to fight back
against my friends who kept beating me with some meme opening strategies. The bot has won against them, so I will not
continue it any further.

## Credits
I got some valuable insights from https://www.chessprogramming.org/. Especially my evaluation function was mostly a copy + paste from https://www.chessprogramming.org/Simplified_Evaluation_Function
